CSCI 520, Assignment 2

Jinsen Wu

================

<Description of what you have accomplished>
1. Implemented Skinning.
2. Implemented computeLocalAndGlobalTransforms and computeJointTransforms.
3. Implemented forwardKinematicsFunction, train_adolc and doIK.

<Also, explain any extra credit that you have implemented.>
1. Implement Dual-Quaternion Skinning.
2. Implement the pseudoinverse IK method and compare it with other IK algorithm
3. When the user moves the IK handle for a long distance, divide the IK process into several sub-steps to improve the solution, where each sub-step solves the IK problem on a portion of the original distance
4. Modified Driver.cpp, allow switching between Linear Blending and Dual Quaternion Blending with 'd' during runtime.

4. Provide a detailed report on methods used comparison, check file HW3Report
Provide a comparison between linear blend skinning and dual quaternion skinning
